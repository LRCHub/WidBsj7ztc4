[00:10.04] You're fighting me off like a firefighter
[00:14.19] So tell me why you still get burned
[00:18.06] You say you're not, but you're still a liar
[00:21.75] 'Cause I'm the one that you run to first
[00:41.75] 
[00:25.07] Every time, yeah
[00:26.42] Why do you try to deny it
[00:30.32] When you show up every night
[00:34.01] And tell me that you want me but it's complicated
[00:40.05] So complicated
[00:47.05] 
[00:41.56] When it hurts but it hurts so good
[00:45.63] Do you take it?
[00:47.63] Do you break it off?
[00:49.63] When it hurts but it hurts so good
[00:53.61] Can you say it?
[00:55.57] Can you say it?
[01:03.07] 
[00:57.32] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[01:01.24] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[01:04.94] It hurts so good (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[01:08.98] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[01:12.95] It hurts so good
[01:20.95] 
[01:14.49] Every time that I swear it's over
[01:18.05] It makes you want me even more
[01:22.10] You pull away and I come in closer
[01:26.07] And all we ever stay is torn
[01:40.07] 
[01:29.39] And baby, I don't know
[01:31.08] Why I try to deny it
[01:34.40] When you show up every night
[01:38.33] I tell you that I want you but it's complicated
[01:44.08] So complicated
[01:51.08] 
[01:45.66] When it hurts but it hurts so good
[01:49.56] Do you take it?
[01:51.62] Do you break it off?
[01:53.64] When it hurts but it hurts so good
[01:57.62] Can you say it?
[01:59.48] Can you say it?
[02:06.98] 
[02:01.11] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[02:04.95] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[02:08.99] It hurts so good (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[02:12.94] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[02:16.50] Ooh, it hurts so good
[02:27.00] 
[02:18.96] Wide awake through the daylight
[02:21.77] Will you hold me like we're running a yellow light?
[02:26.81] Reach for you with my hands tied
[02:29.59] Are we dancing like we're burning in paradise?
[02:52.59] 
[02:36.98] When it hurts but it hurts so good
[02:41.59] Do you take it?
[02:43.61] Do you break it off?
[02:45.50] When it hurts but it hurts so good
[02:49.63] Can you say it?
[02:51.50] Can you say it?
[02:59.00] 
[02:53.16] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[02:57.03] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[03:00.63] Ooh, it hurts so good (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[03:05.06] Your love is like (hey, na-na-na, na-na)
[03:09.00] It hurts so good
